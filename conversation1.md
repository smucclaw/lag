## Let's explore a scenario in which I, the insured party, accidentally die during a sky-diving event. Will the policy pay out?

In the scenario where you, the insured party, accidentally die during a sky-diving event, the policy would not pay out. The document specifies that accidental death benefits do not cover deaths resulting from participation in professional and dangerous sports such as sky-diving, especially if performed in a capacity where the individual earns income, such as an instructor or coach. This exclusion is listed to manage the high risks associated with such activities.

## The insurance policy mentions potholing. What the heck is that?

Potholing, also known as spelunking or caving, is the recreational activity of exploring wild cave systems. The term often refers to the exploration of caves that involve some level of climbing, crawling, and potentially swimming through underground water systems. It's considered a dangerous sport due to risks like falls, flooding, and getting lost within complex cave networks. This activity is often listed in insurance policies as an exclusion due to its hazardous nature.

## OK. Back to the sky-diving scenario. What if I'm sky-diving but not as an instructor or coach, just a thrill-seeker who wants to jump out of a plane as a paying customer of a sky-diving sport service?

In the scenario where you are sky-diving purely as a thrill-seeker and not as an instructor or professional, the policy would likely cover an accidental death. The exclusion specifically mentions participating in such activities in a professional capacity or as an instructor from which income is earned. If the activity is done recreationally as a paying customer, it generally does not fall under the exclusions listed in the policy, assuming no other excluded conditions apply.

## OK. Now, what if I participate in the sky-diving operation as part of a military operation, in which I'm a full-time soldier in the armed services?

If you participate in sky-diving as part of a military operation and you are a full-time soldier in the armed services, the accidental death coverage from the policy would not apply. The policy explicitly excludes any accidental deaths caused by or due to war or any act related to it, or service in the armed forces or in a Civil Defence Force supporting any country at war. This exclusion includes participation in military operations, which would encompass activities like sky-diving during military exercises or maneuvers.

## What if I'm a full-time soldier serving pursuant to national service duties, during my time as an NSF?

If you're serving as a full-time soldier under national service duties, the accidental death coverage might still apply. The policy excludes military activities related to warlike operations, but there's an exception for national service or reservist duties carried out in Singapore or overseas under the Enlistment Act. This implies that accidental deaths occurring during such sanctioned duties might still be covered, depending on the specific circumstances and the exact wording of the policy.

## But what if I'm not a full-time NSman, but have signed on as a regular?

If you've signed on as a regular in the armed forces, the accidental death coverage likely would not apply if your death occurs during activities deemed as military operations, including sky-diving. The policy explicitly excludes deaths caused by or related to military service during warlike operations, maneuvers, or any similar military activities. This exclusion typically applies regardless of whether one is a full-time national serviceman or a regular personnel.

## I think you just contradicted yourself in the last two paragraphs.

Apologies for the confusion. Let's clarify:

- **As a National Serviceman (NSF)**: The policy does cover accidental deaths during national service or reservist duties, as specifically stated. This exception is likely in place to cover mandatory military service that all eligible Singaporean males must undergo.

- **As a Regular in the Armed Forces**: If you've signed on as a regular, meaning you are employed full-time by the military, the exclusion related to military service would apply. This includes deaths during military operations, maneuvers, or any related activities, such as sky-diving for military purposes.

Thus, the difference hinges on whether the military activity is part of compulsory national service duties or part of a voluntary regular military engagement. The policy treats these two scenarios differently in terms of coverage.

## What if my role as an NSF is to be a sky-diving instructor or coach? Which clause takes precedence?

In the scenario where you are serving as a National Serviceman (NSF) and your role is specifically to be a sky-diving instructor or coach, the exclusion for engaging in professional and dangerous sports as an instructor from which income is earned would likely apply. This would generally mean that the policy would not cover an accidental death in this situation, even though you are performing these duties as part of your national service. The exclusion for professional sports activities typically overrides the general coverage for military duties under national service, especially when the activity is explicitly listed as an exclusion in the insurance policy.

## But one might argue that coaching sky-diving in a military operation is not being performed as a sport but as a matter of life and death.

That's a valid point. In such a scenario, the context in which the sky-diving is conducted could indeed influence the interpretation of the insurance policy's exclusions. If sky-diving is part of military training or operations and is essential for the duties of an NSF, rather than a sportive or recreational activity, it might not fall under the typical exclusions for professional sports. This could be argued as a necessary military skill development rather than a sport, potentially aligning it more closely with covered activities under the terms for national service. However, the final decision would depend on the specific language of the policy and possibly, interpretations by the insurer or legal adjudications in disputed cases.
